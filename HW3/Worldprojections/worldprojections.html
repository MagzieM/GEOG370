    <h1>Exploring World Map Projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Using QGIS software</h2>
    <p>There are 4 main components of a spherical map: area, shape, distance, and direction. When projected onto a 2D surface,
        some of these components must be sacrificed. Mathematicians and cartographers create various projections in an attempt to preserve different components based on
        the planned use of the map. For instance, for navigation, distance and direction are usually the most important components.
        Each of the 9 projections below were made with different goals for preserving different map components. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Direction and angle are preserved, but distances have distorted widths toward the poles - for example the antarctic continent is as wide as the equator.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Preserves distance and partially preserves shape and area. Angles are less distorted than on some other projections.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator</h2>
    <h3>Preserves angles and direction while distorting distance and area, especially toward the poles.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Sphere Winkel I</h2>
    <h3>Spherical projection created to compromise between area, shape, and size at the expense of angles/direction.</h3>

    <img src=".//maps/53018.png" alt="Sphere Winkel I" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>A cylindrical projection created to preserve area at the extreme expense of shape distortion.  </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>Projection made with the cone method, attempts to preserve distance with the least distortions at the north pole and the greatest at the south pole.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54027.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54027.png" alt="World Equidistant Conic" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>Similar to the conical projection above, with similar distortions, but the globe is projected in a full circle using the azimuthal method in which direction is preserved relative to the North Pole.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Eckert I</h2>
    <h3>Attempts to preserve shape and area while compromising direction.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/53015.png">
    <img src=".//maps/53015.png" alt="Sphere Eckert I" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Sphere Craster Parabolic</h2>
    <h3>A projection which attempts to preserve area at the expense of direction/angles - with the greatest distortion at the East/West edges of the map.</h3>
