<h1>Georeferencing 1972 Aerial Image of Bethlehem PA</h1>

<h3>Georeferenced Map</h3>    
<p> This aerial image from 1972 shows Bethlehem, PA streets as they were the year my 
    grandfather taught my mother to drive. This was the year she learned she was night-blind as she
    drove her car into a neighbor's front lawn. Unfortunately the address of this incident was lost to time.

    The 2015 image shows how downtown Bethlehem has changed over the last 40+ years.</p>
